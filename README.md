Sushi Restaurant Website – Project Overview

I developed a modern, responsive website for Tuto Sushi Restaurant using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project was to create an engaging and user-friendly online presence that reflects the vibrant and authentic atmosphere of the restaurant.

Key Features:
Clean and Responsive Design: Built with HTML5 and CSS3 to ensure compatibility across all devices and screen sizes.

Interactive User Experience: JavaScript was used to enhance interactivity, including menu filtering, image sliders, and smooth scrolling.

Navigation and Layout: Intuitive navigation makes it easy for users to explore the menu, view restaurant details, and contact or book a reservation.

Aesthetic Presentation: The design emphasizes Japanese culture through subtle animations, elegant fonts, and high-quality visuals of sushi dishes.

Performance Optimized: Lightweight and fast-loading for a seamless browsing experience.

This project highlights my skills in front-end web development, UI/UX design, and attention to detail. The Tuto Sushi website not only showcases the restaurant’s offerings but also provides an enjoyable digital experience for potential customers.
